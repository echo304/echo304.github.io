<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> is one of the powerful modern language created by Microsoft. It succeed C++ and somewhat improved(or varied) version of Java which is the most used language in the world. But due to its origin(Microsoft), basically C# is available on Windows O/S environment. I can say that this is the biggest reason why C# hasn't been used widely despite of its functionality. For more detail history of C#, you can find it on Wikipedia.

But thanks to <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono Project</a>, Mac users are now allowed to develop an application on their machine with C#, although there are some compatibility issue about Mono project. Technically Mono is an open-source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework that allows developers to create cross platform application.

<h4>Step</h4>
1. Download Mono for OSX <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">Here</a><br>
2. Download Xamarin Studio Community  for OSX <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/download">Here</a><br>
<br>

Xamarin Studio is minor downgraded version of Visual Studio which is well known IDE for C#. But even though Xamarin Studio has some missing parts, it's extremely powerful and convenient tool to develop C#(shout out to InteliSence!)

Well, this is all for today's post. Actually, I've started to learn C# for the coding exercise I've got from Amazon. And I've written this post to help other developer who want to start using C# on their Mac without installing VM or buying Windows.

Happy Coding!
