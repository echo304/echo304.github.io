title:  "Use Cluster to make your Node.js App fast"
---

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> is well known as its high scalability. With its scalability, Node.js is still growing as a server-side run-time environment can handle heavy traffic like statistics related job. That's why some large company not only small company integrate Node.js in their server-side platform.

Basically, Node.js process runs in a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)" target="_blank">thread</a> and by default it has a memory limit of 512MB on 32-bit systems and 1GM on 64-bit systems, which is quite limited resources. And this can cause critical performance issue, when it has tons of work to do.

To solve this problem, Node.js provide <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html#cluster_cluster" target="_blank">Cluster</a> which make it possible to run multi process not single process. Cluster module allows you to create Worker, which share all the server ports with the main Node process.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What does it mean? </h4>
<br>
Explain it easily, You Can Run Your Server with Several Workers!
<br>
<br>
Let's create Workers.
<br>
<br>

``` javascript
var cluster = require('cluster');
var http = require('http');

// Extract CPU info. from 'os' module
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

// If the server where incoming connection hit is Master server,
// it will create the workers
if(cluster.isMaster) {
  for(var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
// If the server where incoming connection hit is not Master server,
// Do some stuff
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`process ${process.pid} says hello!`);
  }).listen(8000);
}
```
<br>
The Worker is spawned using `.fork()` method, so that that can communicate with master and handle server's work together. Then, how Node.js distribute incoming connections to its Workers? It support two method.

The first one(default setting) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling" target="_blank">Round-robin</a> approach, where the master process listens on a connection and distribute them across the workers i a round-robin fashion with built-in smarts to avoid overloading a particular worker.

The second approach is where the master process creates the listen socket and sends it to interested workers. The workers accept incoming connection directly.

In Theory, the second one should be the best performance but practically it's not. So the first approach is recommended.

With the above code, Node.js will create the workers refering to the number of CPU on the machine where the server is running.

It's not funny, though. Let's do some practical test.
<br>
<br>

``` javascript
var cluster = require('cluster');
var http = require('http');

// Extract CPU info. from 'os' module
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

// If the server where incoming connection hit is Master server,
// it will create the workers
if(cluster.isMaster) {
  for(var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
// If the server where incoming connection hit is not Master server,
// Do some time expensive Work
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    var startTime = Date.now();
    var endTime;
    
    // Expensive server work
    for(var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
      endTime = Date.now()
    }
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`process ${process.pid} says hello! \n time: ${endTime - startTime}`);
  }).listen(8000);
}
```
<br>
With the above code, Node creates the workers(in my case, 4 workers) and let them handle server's time expensive job. On the other hand, below code is just simple single process node server which handle every incoming connection without worker's help
<br>
<br>

``` javascript
var http = require('http');

  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    var startTime = Date.now();
    var endTime;
    
    // Expensive server work
    for(var i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
      endTime = Date.now()
    }
    res.writeHead(200, defaultCorsHeaders);
    res.end(`process ${process.pid} says hello! \n time: ${endTime - startTime}`);
  }).listen(8001);
}

```
